## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the project, you need to run the following command:

```
$ yarn deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying nhl-data-pipeline to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack nhl-data-pipeline-dev (112s)

functions:
  hello: nhl-data-pipeline-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke --function handleScheduleFeed
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\"message\":\"SQS Message sent!\"}"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

The response will be different, due to the project's dependency on AWS services:

```
Could not resolve "QUEUE_URL" environment variable: Unsupported environment variable format: {
  'Fn::Sub': 'https://sqs.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/${AWS::AccountId}/schedule-to-game-logic-queue'
}
```
